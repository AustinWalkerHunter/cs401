    <p>Mr. and <span class="highlight">Mrs. Dursley</span>, of number four, Privet Drive, were
proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank
you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved
in anything strange or <span class="adj">mysterious</span>, because they just didn't
hold with such nonsense.</p>

<p title="paragraph 1">
Mr. Dursley was the director of a fi rm called Grunnings, which
made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although
he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin
and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which
came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over
garden fences, spying on the neighbors.  e Dursleys had a small
son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no fi ner boy
anywhere.
